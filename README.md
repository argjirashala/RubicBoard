Rubik board

This game is a two dimension variant of the Rubik cube. The board of the game consists of n x n fields. 
There are n different colors, and exactly n fields have the same color. The fields are shuffled initially. 
A player can move cyclically the colors of a row or column (e.g. moving a row to the right, the color of the first field will be the color the last field) 
to make homogenous rows and columns. The game ends, when each row (or column) contains one color.
The board size is selectable (2x2, 4x4, 6x6). 
The game recognizes if it is ended, and it shows in a message box how much steps did it take to solve the game. 
After this, a new game will be started automatically.
